As an Analog & Mixed-Signal Designer, it is important to understand the **Digital logic basics**, in addition to the Analog circuits basics.
# Steps to Master the Digital-logic/circuits Basics
&ensp; 1- Understand the basics of Digital logic design, using logic gates & flipflops as blackboxes.</br>
&ensp; 2- Try to have some proficiency with an HDL, either Verilog or VHDL. </br>
&ensp; 3- Understand the basics of Digital circuit design, which includes building digital logic & flipflops on the transistor level.</br>
&ensp; 4- [Project] Build some combinational & sequential logic using **Verilog/VHDL** on a free online compiler like [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/).</br>
&ensp; 5- [Project] Build some combinational & sequential logic on the transistor level, & simulate it on Cadence Virtuoso.</br>
